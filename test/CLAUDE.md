# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a fresh/empty workspace. The repository is initialized with git but contains no files yet.

## Development Environment

- Platform: Linux
- Working directory: /home/admin/cc/test
- Git repository: Yes (master branch)

## Common Commands

Since this is an empty workspace, standard commands will depend on the project type once files are added:

### For Node.js projects:
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linter

### For Python projects:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install dependencies
- `python -m pytest` - Run tests
- `python -m flake8` - Run linter
- `python main.py` - Run application

### For other project types:
Commands will need to be determined based on the actual project structure and configuration files.

## Getting Started

1. Check for package.json (Node.js), requirements.txt (Python), or other dependency files
2. Look for README.md for project-specific instructions
3. Identify the main entry point and build system
4. Set up the development environment based on the project type
